Reminder - NEVER CLONE A REPO INTO A REPO

Modify - Do something to make changes!

git add . - This adds everything in THIS folder up

git -A adds everything in subfolders too

git commit-m "Meaningful message" - This preps the files to go with a message included

git pull origin main - This pulls any existing changes before sending.  This is good to do when working with groups.

git push origin main - This actually pushes the files to the cloud
